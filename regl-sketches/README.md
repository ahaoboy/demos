# regl-sketches

So glad you found this! First things first, this directory is a *build* directory, not a source directory. So the code is not at all readable. For the example source, see the [src](https://github.com/rreusser/demos/tree/master/regl-sketches/src) directory. Apologies that's not clearer. See, github has web hosting now...

Anyway, glad you found this and I hope you find something interesting. [regl](github.com/regl-project/regl) is a great tool for making cool things very quickly! If you're interseted in trying it out, I make a blog post about going [From Nothing to Something in WebGL using regl](http://rickyreusser.com/2016/12/07/from-nothing-to-something-in-webgl/) and also an example about [Smoothly animating points with regl](https://github.com/rreusser/smoothly-animating-points-with-regl). Either of those is a great place to start in case you're not already intimately familiar with these things. Once you get going, the [regl example gallery](https://regl-project.github.io/regl/www/gallery.html) has plenty simple and more complicated examples.
