# regl-cwise

> A subset of [cwise](https://github.com/scijs/cwise) on the GPU

Computation on the GPU is completely different from computation on the CPU, so we'll never get a direct WebGL port of [cwise](https://github.com/scijs/cwise), but this repo implements some of the basic rudimentary function of cwise. Currently only a map operation is implemented, but a [scan operation](https://github.com/rreusser/demos/tree/master/regl-scan) and reduce operation are planned.
