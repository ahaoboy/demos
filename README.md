# demos

This is hopefully one repo to manage all the demos I've been accumulating or at least a place to dump the new ones.

- [schrodinger](http://rickyreusser.com/demos/schrodinger/): A response to [this tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/mathteacher1729/status/789489981966409728)
- [lorenz](http://rickyreusser.com/demos/lorenz/): A 500000 particle Lorenz Attractor, computed and displayed in WebGL
- [waves](http://rickyreusser.com/demos/waves/): A 2D wave equation on the GPU
- [regl-scan](http://rickyreusser.com/demos/regl-scan/): The [scan (prefix-sum)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum) operation on the GPU
- [carpet](http://rickyreusser.com/demos/carpet/): Carpet plots with regl
