# demos

This is hopefully one repo to manage all the demos I've been accumulating or at least a place to dump the new ones. I've assigned them totally subjective, meaningless stars. Mainly just to help you avoid wasting your time. It's like Netflix. [Anything less than 3.5 stars...](https://xkcd.com/1098/)
